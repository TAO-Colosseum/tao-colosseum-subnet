TAO Colosseum Validator

This is the main entry point for running a TAO Colosseum validator.
The validator:
1. Periodically checks betting volumes from the TAO Colosseum smart contract
2. Calculates time-decayed rewards (7 days, recent activity weighted higher)
3. Sets weights on the Bittensor network based on miner betting activity
4. Provides a REST API for querying validator state

Usage:
    python validator/validator.py --netuid <NETUID> --wallet.name <WALLET> --wallet.hotkey <HOTKEY>

API Endpoints (default port 8000):
    GET /health        - Validator health status
    GET /scores        - Current miner scores
    GET /volumes       - Current betting volumes
    GET /leaderboard   - Top miners by score
    GET /snapshots     - Historical weight snapshots

    Features:
    - Time-decayed volume rewards (7-day window)
    - Automatic weight setting every 360 blocks (~72 min)
    - REST API for querying state
    - Snapshot storage for historical data

    - Database initialization
    - API server startup
    - Metagraph syncing
    - Weight setting with snapshot saving
